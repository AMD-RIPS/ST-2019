Download the .pkl files for the five glitches, and put them into the correct folders respectively.

### PCA models

1. shapes-PCA-300.pkl -> Put into folder "shape_test"

2. sqp-PCA-234.pkl -> Put into folder "square_patch_test"

3. stut-PCA-100.pkl -> Put into folder "stuttering_test"

4. triang-PCA-400.pkl -> Put into folder "triangulation_test"

5. discolor-PCA-500.pkl -> Put into folder "discoloration_test"
