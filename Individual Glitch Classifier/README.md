## Important Note (Please READ):

The four PCA pkl files are missing from four folders because they are tooooo big. 

Go to:

https://drive.google.com/open?id=1j9NC1SFPMl6BIZFIeQQjyLmk3VEaqGhf

Download the 4 .pkl files for the 4 glitches, and put them into the 4 folders respectively.

1. shapes-PCA-300.pkl -> Put into folder "shape_test"

2. sqp-PCA-234.pkl -> Put into folder "square_patch_test"

3. stut-PCA-100.pkl -> Put into folder "stuttering_test"

4. triang-PCA-400.pkl -> Put into folder "triangulation_test"


## More Note

Downdload the file: https://drive.google.com/file/d/11rlDpGM6DqEKPfH9Ru0rKusfwflVwDYw/view?usp=sharing
